# Quick Start

Get the Vio Swift SDK running in your app in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Add the Package

In Xcode: **File → Add Package Dependencies...**

```
https://github.com/ReachuDevteam/ReachuSwiftSDK.git
```

Select the latest version and add the modules you need (e.g. `ReachuCore`, `ReachuUI`).

## 2. Configure the SDK

In your app's entry point (e.g. `@main` App struct):

```swift
import ReachuCore

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    init() {
        // Configure with your API credentials
        ReachuSDK.configure(
            apiKey: "your-api-key",
            environment: .production
        )
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Add a Product Card

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ReachuUI

struct ProductListView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ProductCard(
                productId: "123",
                title: "Sample Product",
                price: 29.99
            )
        }
    }
}
```

## 4. Run Your App

Build and run. You should see the product card rendered with the Vio styling.
